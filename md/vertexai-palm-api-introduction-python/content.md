Creating a Google Codelab for your Python project is a great way to share your work and guide others through the process of using it. Below, I'll outline the Codelab in Markdown format, breaking down the steps in a beginner-friendly manner. This Codelab assumes that the user has a Google Cloud Platform account with active billing and a local development environment with Python installed.

# Building a Chatbot with Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Flask

## Introduction

In this Codelab, we'll walk through creating a simple chatbot using Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Flask, a popular web framework in Python. Our chatbot will generate poems in a Shakespearean style with a touch of humor, based on a user's input.

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account with active billing.
- Python installed on your local machine.
- Basic understanding of Python and web applications.

## Setup

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Google Cloud Environment

1. Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account.
2. Create a new project, let's name it `gcp-adventure-x`.
3. Enable billing for the project.
4. Navigate to the APIs & Services dashboard and enable the Vertex AI API.
5. Create a service account and download the JSON key file (`key.json`). Store this file safely.

### Step 2: Setting Up Your Local Environment

1. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```
2. Install other required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install marko google-oauth vertexai
   ```

## Building the Application

### Step 3: Understanding the Code

1. **Importing Libraries**: We start by importing necessary Python libraries. Flask for our web framework, Vertex AI for AI model interaction, and others for various functionalities.
2. **Initializing the App and Vertex AI**: We initialize our Flask app and configure Vertex AI with our GCP project details.
3. **Defining Routes**: We define two routes - one for the home page and another for handling chat messages.
4. **Chat Function**: This function takes a message, sends it to the AI model, and returns a poem based on the message.

### Step 4: Writing the Code

Copy the code provided into a Python file, say `app.py`.

### Step 5: Running the App

1. Run your application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see your chatbot interface.

## Testing the Chatbot

### Step 6: Interacting with Your Chatbot

1. Enter a message in the chat interface.
2. The chatbot will respond with a Shakespearean-style poem, humorously tailored to your message.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just built and deployed a simple chatbot using Flask and Google Cloud's Vertex AI. This bot takes user input and generates creative, Shakespearean-style poems with a humorous twist.

## What's Next?

- Experiment with different model parameters to see how they affect the output.
- Try integrating this chatbot into a larger web application.
- Explore other capabilities of Vertex AI.
